# Specification Gaps and Remaining Work

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-19
**Overall Status:** 853 / 853 tests passing, 1 skipped — all high- and medium-priority gaps verified or resolved.

> The test count was previously reported as `355/355` and as `321/321` in
> sibling documents. Both were stale; the figure above is the actual count
> produced by `go test ./... -count=1 -v` against this commit (528 top-level
> tests + 325 subtests = 853 passing). See `SPEC_COMPLIANCE_STATUS.md` for the

This document identifies remaining gaps between the current implementation and CSS specifications, prioritized by impact and feasibility.

## ✅ Recently Fixed (All High Priority Issues Resolved!)

### 1. Grid Track Intrinsic Sizing ✅ **FIXED**

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED - Working correctly**

**Location:** `grid.go:747-752`

**Implementation:** Grid tracks with `min-content`, `max-content`, or `fit-content` sizing properly call `resolveIntrinsicTrackSize()` to calculate actual content-based dimensions.

**Current Behavior:**
```go
// grid.go:747-752
if maxSize == SizeMinContent {
    // min-content track: size based on minimum content size
    sizes[i] = resolveIntrinsicTrackSize(track, container, i, isColumn, IntrinsicSizeMinContent, ctx, currentFontSize)
} else if maxSize == SizeMaxContent {
    // max-content track: size based on maximum content size
    sizes[i] = resolveIntrinsicTrackSize(track, container, i, isColumn, IntrinsicSizeMaxContent, ctx, currentFontSize)
}
```

**Impact:** None - Feature fully implemented and working

**Spec Reference:** [CSS Grid Layout §11.5](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/#intrinsic-sizes)

---

### 2. Pre-Existing Test Failures ✅ **ALL FIXED**

**Status:** ✅ **ALL FIXED - 100% test pass rate achieved!**

**Previously failing tests** (now passing):
1. `TestFlexboxFlexWrapReverse` - Y-position for wrap-reverse ✅ Fixed
2. `TestFlexboxPadding` - Container width calculation with padding ✅ Fixed
3. `TestTextBlockIntegration` - TextLayout field population ✅ Fixed
4. `TestTextBlockAutoHeight` - Auto-height calculation for text blocks ✅ Fixed

**Impact:** All issues resolved, test suite now at 100% pass rate

---

## ✅ Additional Verified Features

### 1. Grid Spanning with Margins ✅ **VERIFIED WORKING**

**Location:** `grid_spanning_margin_test.go`

**Status:** ✅ **NOT A BUG - Working correctly**

**Testing:** Grid items that span multiple tracks with margins calculate gaps correctly. Visual gap between spanning items and subsequent rows matches the expected row gap exactly.

**Test Results:**
```
Item 1 bottom (with margin): 110.00
Item 2 top (with margin): 120.00
Visual gap: 10.00
Expected gap: 10.00 (row gap)
✅ Visual gap matches row gap
```

**Impact:** None - Feature working as expected

**Status:** Verified working, documentation updated

---

## 🟢 Low Priority Gaps (Deferred Features)

### 3. RTL and Vertical Writing Modes

**Status:** Explicitly out of scope for v1

**Missing:**
- `direction: rtl` (right-to-left text)
- `writing-mode: vertical-rl` / `vertical-lr`
- Bidirectional text algorithm (Unicode UAX #9)

**Spec Reference:** [CSS Writing Modes Level 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/)

**Impact:** None for LTR-only applications

---

### 4. Hyphenation

**Status:** Explicitly out of scope for v1

**Missing:**
- `hyphens: auto`
- `hyphenate-character`
- `hyphenate-limit-*` properties
- Language-specific hyphenation dictionaries

**Spec Reference:** [CSS Text Module Level 3 §4.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-3/#hyphenation)

**Impact:** None - soft hyphens (U+00AD) are supported

---

### 5. CSS Grid Subgrid (Level 2)

**Status:** Out of scope (Level 2 feature, not Level 1)

**Missing:**
- `grid-template-rows: subgrid`
- `grid-template-columns: subgrid`
- Nested grid alignment

**Spec Reference:** [CSS Grid Layout Level 2 §7](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-2/#subgrids)

**Impact:** None for Level 1 compliance

---

### 6. Text Decorations

**Status:** Deferred (rendering concern, not layout)

**Missing:**
- `text-decoration: underline` / `overline` / `line-through`
- `text-decoration-style`
- `text-decoration-color`
- `text-underline-position`

**Spec Reference:** [CSS Text Decoration Module Level 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-decor-3/)

**Impact:** None - layout calculations don't require decoration

---

### 7. Inline Formatting Context

**Status:** Explicitly out of scope for v1

**Missing:**
- Mixed inline and block elements
- `<span>` elements with inline layout
- Inline-block sizing
- Baseline alignment across inline elements

**Spec Reference:** [CSS Display Module Level 3 §4](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#inline-layout)

**Impact:** None - current text layout handles pure text blocks

---

### 8. Contain Intrinsic Size (Level 4)

**Status:** Advanced feature, not in core specs

**Missing:**
- `contain-intrinsic-width`
- `contain-intrinsic-height`
- `contain-intrinsic-size` shorthand

**Spec Reference:** [CSS Sizing Module Level 4 §4.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-4/#intrinsic-size-override)

**Impact:** None for Level 3 compliance

**Conclusion:** The layout engine has achieved full CSS specification compliance within the documented scope, with 853 tests passing (1 skipped, 0 failing). All high- and medium-priority gaps have been resolved and verified. All previously documented "gaps" (grid track intrinsic sizing and grid spanning margins) have been confirmed to be implemented and functioning correctly. Remaining gaps are exclusively low-priority features or explicitly out of scope for the current implementation.
